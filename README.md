# Apigee Edge Proxy demonstrating RFC 7523 Token Exchange

This API Proxy bundle demonstrates token exchange - JWT for an opaque OAuth token as decribed by [RFC 7523](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7523).

This is the token exchange process employed by Google for various commercial APIs, such as Stackdriver, Drive, and so on.


## Dependencies

This example depends on the JWT verification callout available at [https://github.com/apigee/iloveapis2015-jwt-jwe-jws/tree/master/jwt_signed](https://github.com/apigee/iloveapis2015-jwt-jwe-jws/tree/master/jwt_signed).

The setup depends on the utilities {curl and openssl}, and also the Java-based tool JwtTool, which is included here. To build the Java tool you need maven. 


## The jwt2token Proxy Endpoint

This endpoint performs the token exchange. The basepath is /rfc7523/jwt2token. 

It accepts as input a POST /token

with a x-www-form-urlencoded payload that includes:

* grant_type = urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:jwt-bearer
* assertion = a JWT

The JWT must:
* be signed via RS256 using the public key belonging to the developer.
* have an expiry of no greater than 300s.
* have never been previously used to obtain a token.
* have the correct audience and scope and issuer (==consumer key).

If all these checks  pass, then the proxy generates a client_credentials oauth token and returns it.

## Why

The reason to do token exchange is to allow fast server-side checking of
tokens. JWT are expensive to parse and verify, because they use
public/private key signatures. On the other hand, an opaque OAuth token
generated by Apigee Edge, is really easy and cheap for Apigee Edge to
verify. 

Exchanging a JWT for an opaque token allows a faster token check on the server side, during many many  API requests. 

This token exchange - JWT for an opaque oauth token - is the pattern used by APIs for public Google services, including things like StackDriver, Drive, and so on.

## The Token Exchange Logic 

Here's how the thing works:
* There must be a developer entity registered in Edge
* There must be an API product in Apigee Edge
* There must be an app for the developr, authorized on the API Product
* The app must have a custom attribute named "public_key", and its contents must be the PEM/PKCS8 encoding of a public key.
* The app (or client) must generate a JWT, which is signed with the corresponding private key
* The app sends in the JWT to request an opaque token
* Apigee Edge checks the JWT, and issues the token if everything is valid

The check for validity involves:
* The issuer must be a valid API Key registered in Apigee Edge. Not expired nor revoked.
* The total lifetime of the JWT must be no longer than 5 minutes.
* The issued-at time must be valid.  The not-before-time, if it exists, must be valid. 
* The signature is correct.
* The JWT cannot have been used previously.  (Edge keeps a cache. )


## Provisioning the System

To provision the keys, the developer, the product, and the app, run the provisioning script, like the following:

```
tools/provisionKeysProxyProductDeveloperAndApp.sh   -o ORGNAME  -e ENVNAME
```

Specify your organization name and environment name as appropriate.

The output will finish something like:

```
private key file: private-pkcs8-20161214-201107.pem
public key file: public-20161214-201107.pem

consumer key: ayBZRVAGlmG8BnbQ0YllkCywvi3Ko9wI
consumer secret: m9cdAYxXtu3m7Nde
```


## Generating the required JWT

1. First, build the Java tool that generates the JWT:

   ```
   cd tools/jwttool
   mvn clean install
   cd ../..
   ```

2. then, run the wrapper script to generate a JWT:

   ```
   tools/createJwt.sh -k PRIVATE_KEY_FILE  -i CONSUMER_KEY_HERE
   ```

The CONSUMER_KEY_HERE and the PRIVATE_KEY_FILE that you use here, must be the values shown by
the provisioning script.

You can then check the generated JWT like so:

```
tools/checkJwt.sh -k PUBLIC_KEY_FILE  -t TOKEN
```

You must pass the appropriate public key file and token here.


## Invoking the Proxy to Perform the Exchange

Use this command:

```
curl -X POST -H content-type:application/x-www-form-urlencoded \
  https://ORGNAME-ENVNAME.apigee.net/rfc7523/jwt2token/token \
 -d  'grant_type=urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:jwt-bearer&assertion=JWT_HERE'
```

You will need to insert the rather long JWT in the appropriate place.
Also insert your ORGNAME and ENVNAME as appropriate.


## De-Provisioning the System

To remove the developer, the product, and the app, run the provisioning script with the -r option, like the following:

```
tools/provisionKeysProxyProductDeveloperAndApp.sh   -o ORGNAME  -e ENVNAME -r

```
